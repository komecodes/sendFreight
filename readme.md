# Recreating send.ng new booking page

## Status

Almost complete! I am currently working on making the icons on the Services section look better and also change them when their parent element is clicked.

I'll also be refactoring my code and making things look cleaner by fixing any alignment/layout issues.

## Process

This was quite fun to create. I spent about 4 hours putting it together ***(up to this stage that is)***. Started by getting the layout right by setting up the HTML while ignoring beauty. It took about an hour before I got somewhat satisfied. Then came the fun part, CSS!

Starting from the header and working my way down, I flexed and grided everything that needed to be flexed and grided,then positioned elements that needed positioning. Particularly had fun with position: "absolute"; üòÅ .

Got the icons on the page and positioned them as well, and then, came the colors, border, border-radius, font and all the other beauty!
